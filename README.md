# University-Database-Query-Project
In this project, I built a standalone Java application using JDBC to connect to a MySQL-based university database. The application executes a series of SQL queries to answer real-world academic data questions such as:

Calculating student GPAs from letter grades

Finding the most frequently used classroom (without ORDER BY)

Extracting prerequisites for courses (handling nulls and joins)

Writing and calling a stored procedure to report department salary and budget data

Updating and verifying credit totals across student records
